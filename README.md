# My Town Tracker

Welcome to My Town Tracker! This is a Sinatra Web Application that tracks info about places you've been and/or want to go. Keep track of restaurants, attractions, parks, or any other places you're interested in.  


## Installation (update)

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'my-town-tracker'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install my-town-tracker

## Usage

To get started using My-Town-Tracker: 
 1. Login or create a new account.
 2. If you want to check out the places you've already entered, click "View My Places." You'll see a list of places and a status bar showing how many you've previously visited vs. how many are still on your to-go list.
 3. You can then filter your list to hunt for places fitting specific criteria.
 4. Once you find a place you're interested in, click it and you'll see any info you've entered for that place.
 5. You can also Edit or Delete the record from this show page.
 6. To enter a new place, click "New Place" from the User Home Page or Places Page.
 7. Enter any and all information that you have available then click "Create Place."  

## Development (udpdate)

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `rake/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
